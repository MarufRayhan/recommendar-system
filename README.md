# Recommender Systems Course assignments

## About This repo
This repository contains my project for the Recommender Systems course I undertook as part of my studies. The assignments aims to explore and implement various recommender system algorithms and techniques to provide personalized recommendations to users.

### Course Objectives
The main objectives of this course were to understand the fundamental principles of recommender systems, including:
- Collaborative filtering (user-item filtering)
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid methods combining collaborative and content-based filtering
- Evaluation metrics for recommender systems

### Project Overview
In this assignments, I implemented and evaluated different types of recommender systems. The project included:
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Implementation of various recommendation algorithms
- Evaluation of the systems based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics
- Exploration of advanced topics like matrix factorization techniques, deep learning in recommender systems, or handling cold start problems

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on what you used)
- Jupyter Notebook
